    This macro expands a numeric value of the form 0xMMNNPP (MM = major, NN = minor, PP = patch) that specifies LibIrcClient-Qt's version number.
    For example, if you compile your application against LibIrcClient-Qt 1.2.3, the IRC_VERSION macro will expand to 0x010203.

    You can use IRC_VERSION to use the latest LibIrcClient-Qt features where available. For example:
    \code
#if IRC_VERSION >= 0x000300
    session->setSocket(new QSslSocket(session));
    session->connectToServer(host, port);
#endif
    \endcode
